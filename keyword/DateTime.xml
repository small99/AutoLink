<doc>A test library for handling date and time values.

``DateTime`` is a Robot Framework standard library that supports creating and
converting date and time values (e.g. `Get Current Date`, `Convert Time`),
as well as doing simple calculations with them (e.g. `Subtract Time From Date`,
`Add Time To Time`). It supports dates and times in various formats, and can
also be used by other libraries programmatically.

This library is new in Robot Framework 2.8.5.

= Terminology =

In the context of this library, ``date`` and ``time`` generally have following
meanings:

- ``date``: An entity with both date and time components but without any
   timezone information. For example, ``2014-06-11 10:07:42``.
- ``time``: A time interval. For example, ``1 hour 20 minutes`` or ``01:20:00``.

This terminology differs from what Python's standard
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html|datetime] module uses.
Basically its
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects|datetime] and
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects|timedelta]
objects match ``date`` and ``time`` as defined by this library.

= Date formats =

Dates can given to and received from keywords in `timestamp`, `custom
timestamp`, `Python datetime` and `epoch time` formats. These formats are
discussed thoroughly in subsequent sections.

Input format is determined automatically based on the given date except when
using custom timestamps, in which case it needs to be given using
``date_format`` argument. Default result format is timestamp, but it can
be overridden using ``result_format`` argument.

== Timestamp ==

If a date is given as a string, it is always considered to be a timestamp.
If no custom formatting is given using ``date_format`` argument, the timestamp
is expected to be in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601|ISO 8601] like
format ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.mil``, where any non-digit character can be used
as a separator or separators can be omitted altogether. Additionally,
only the date part is mandatory, all possibly missing time components are
considered to be zeros.

Dates can also be returned in the same ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.mil`` format by
using ``timestamp`` value with ``result_format`` argument. This is also the
default format that keywords returning dates use. Milliseconds can be excluded
using ``exclude_millis`` as explained in `Millisecond handling` section.

Examples:
| ${date1} =      | Convert Date | 2014-06-11 10:07:42.000 |
| ${date2} =      | Convert Date | 20140611 100742         | result_format=timestamp |
| Should Be Equal | ${date1}     | ${date2}                |
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | 20140612 12:57          | exclude_millis=yes |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | 2014-06-12 12:57:00     |

== Custom timestamp ==

It is possible to use custom timestamps in both input and output.
The custom format is same as accepted by Python's
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior|
datatime.strptime] function. For example, the default timestamp discussed
in the previous section would match ``%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f``.

When using a custom timestamp in input, it must be specified using
``date_format`` argument. The actual input value must be a string that matches
the specified format exactly. When using a custom timestamp in output, it must
be given using ``result_format`` argument.

Examples:
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | 28.05.2014 12:05        | date_format=%d.%m.%Y %H:%M |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | 2014-05-28 12:05:00.000 |
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | ${date}                 | result_format=%d.%m.%Y |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | 28.05.2014              |

Notice that locale aware directives like ``%b``  do not work correctly with
Jython on non-English locales: http://bugs.jython.org/issue2285

== Python datetime ==

Python's standard
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime|datetime]
objects can be used both in input and output. In input they are recognized
automatically, and in output it is possible to get them by giving ``datetime``
value to ``result_format`` argument.

One nice benefit with datetime objects is that they have different time
components available as attributes that can be easily accessed using the
extended variable syntax.

Examples:
| ${datetime} = | Convert Date | 2014-06-11 10:07:42.123 | datetime |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.year}        | 2014   |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.month}       | 6      |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.day}         | 11     |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.hour}        | 10     |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.minute}      | 7      |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.second}      | 42     |
| Should Be Equal As Integers | ${datetime.microsecond} | 123000 |

== Epoch time ==

Epoch time is the time in seconds since the
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time|UNIX epoch] i.e. 00:00:00.000 (UTC)
1 January 1970. To give a date in epoch time, it must be given as a number
(integer or float), not as a string. To return a date in epoch time,
it is possible to use ``epoch`` value with ``result_format`` argument.
Epoch time is returned as a floating point number.

Notice that epoch time itself is independent on timezones and thus same
around the world at a certain time. What local time a certain epoch time
matches obviously then depends on the timezone. For example, examples below
were tested in Finland but verifications would fail on other timezones.

Examples:
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | ${1000000000}           |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | 2001-09-09 04:46:40.000 |
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | 2014-06-12 13:27:59.279 | epoch |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | ${1402568879.279}       |

== Earliest supported date ==

The earliest date that is supported depends on the date format and to some
extend on the platform:

- Timestamps support year 1900 and above.
- Python datetime objects support year 1 and above.
- Epoch time supports 1970 and above on Windows with Python and IronPython.
- On other platforms epoch time supports 1900 and above or even earlier.

Prior to Robot Framework 2.9.2, all formats had same limitation as epoch time
has nowadays.

= Time formats =

Similarly as dates, times can be given to and received from keywords in
various different formats. Supported formats are `number`, `time string`
(verbose and compact), `timer string` and `Python timedelta`.

Input format for time is always determined automatically based on the input.
Result format is number by default, but it can be customised using
``result_format`` argument.

== Number ==

Time given as a number is interpreted to be seconds. It can be given
either as an integer or a float, or it can be a string that can be converted
to a number.

To return a time as a number, ``result_format`` argument must have value
``number``, which is also the default. Returned number is always a float.

Examples:
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 3.14    |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | ${3.14} |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | ${time} | result_format=number |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | ${3.14} |

== Time string ==

Time strings are strings in format like ``1 minute 42 seconds`` or ``1min 42s``.
The basic idea of this format is having first a number and then a text
specifying what time that number represents. Numbers can be either
integers or floating point numbers, the whole format is case and space
insensitive, and it is possible to add a minus prefix to specify negative
times. The available time specifiers are:

- ``days``, ``day``, ``d``
- ``hours``, ``hour``, ``h``
- ``minutes``, ``minute``, ``mins``, ``min``, ``m``
- ``seconds``, ``second``, ``secs``, ``sec``, ``s``
- ``milliseconds``, ``millisecond``, ``millis``, ``ms``

When returning a time string, it is possible to select between ``verbose``
and ``compact`` representations using ``result_format`` argument. The verbose
format uses long specifiers ``day``, ``hour``, ``minute``, ``second`` and
``millisecond``, and adds ``s`` at the end when needed. The compact format uses
shorter specifiers ``d``, ``h``, ``min``, ``s`` and ``ms``, and even drops
the space between the number and the specifier.

Examples:
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 1 minute 42 seconds |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | ${102}              |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 4200                | verbose |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | 1 hour 10 minutes   |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | - 1.5 hours         | compact |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | - 1h 30min          |

== Timer string ==

Timer string is a string given in timer like format ``hh:mm:ss.mil``. In this
format both hour and millisecond parts are optional, leading and trailing
zeros can be left out when they are not meaningful, and negative times can
be represented by adding a minus prefix.

To return a time as timer string, ``result_format`` argument must be given
value ``timer``. Timer strings are by default returned in full ``hh:mm:ss.mil``
format, but milliseconds can be excluded using ``exclude_millis`` as explained
in `Millisecond handling` section.

Examples:
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 01:42        |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | ${102}       |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 01:10:00.123 |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | ${4200.123}  |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 102          | timer |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | 00:01:42.000 |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | -101.567     | timer | exclude_millis=yes |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | -00:01:42    |

== Python timedelta ==

Python's standard
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta|timedelta]
objects are also supported both in input and in output. In input they are
recognized automatically, and in output it is possible to receive them by
giving ``timedelta`` value to ``result_format`` argument.

Examples:
| ${timedelta} =  | Convert Time                 | 01:10:02.123 | timedelta |
| Should Be Equal | ${timedelta.total_seconds()} | ${4202.123}  |

= Millisecond handling =

This library handles dates and times internally using the precision of the
given input. With `timestamp`, `time string`, and `timer string` result
formats seconds are, however, rounded to millisecond accuracy. Milliseconds
may also be included even if there would be none.

All keywords returning dates or times have an option to leave milliseconds out
by giving a true value to ``exclude_millis`` argument. If the argument is given
as a string, it is considered true unless it is empty or case-insensitively
equal to ``false``, ``none`` or ``no``. Other argument types are tested using
same [http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing|rules
as in Python]. Notice that prior to Robot Framework 2.9, all strings except
the empty string were considered true, and that considering ``none`` false is
new in Robot Framework 3.0.3.

When milliseconds are excluded, seconds in returned dates and times are
rounded to the nearest full second. With `timestamp` and `timer string`
result formats, milliseconds will also be removed from the returned string
altogether.

Examples:
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | 2014-06-11 10:07:42     |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | 2014-06-11 10:07:42.000 |
| ${date} =       | Convert Date | 2014-06-11 10:07:42.500 | exclude_millis=yes |
| Should Be Equal | ${date}      | 2014-06-11 10:07:43     |
| ${dt} =         | Convert Date | 2014-06-11 10:07:42.500 | datetime | exclude_millis=yes |
| Should Be Equal | ${dt.second} | ${43}        |
| Should Be Equal | ${dt.microsecond} | ${0}    |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 102          | timer | exclude_millis=false |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | 00:01:42.000 |       |
| ${time} =       | Convert Time | 102.567      | timer | exclude_millis=true |
| Should Be Equal | ${time}      | 00:01:43     |       |

= Programmatic usage =

In addition to be used as normal library, this library is intended to
provide a stable API for other libraries to use if they want to support
same date and time formats as this library. All the provided keywords
are available as functions that can be easily imported:

| from robot.libraries.DateTime import convert_time
|
| def example_keyword(timeout):
|     seconds = convert_time(timeout)
|     # ...

Additionally helper classes ``Date`` and ``Time`` can be used directly:

| from robot.libraries.DateTime import Date, Time
|
| def example_keyword(date, interval):
|     date = Date(date).convert('datetime')
|     interval = Time(interval).convert('number')
|     # ...</doc>
