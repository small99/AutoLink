<doc>Robot Framework test library for verifying and modifying XML documents.

As the name implies, _XML_ is a test library for verifying contents of XML
files. In practice it is a pretty thin wrapper on top of Python's
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html|ElementTree XML API].

The library has the following main usages:

- Parsing an XML file, or a string containing XML, into an XML element
  structure and finding certain elements from it for for further analysis
  (e.g. `Parse XML` and `Get Element` keywords).
- Getting text or attributes of elements
  (e.g. `Get Element Text` and `Get Element Attribute`).
- Directly verifying text, attributes, or whole elements
  (e.g `Element Text Should Be` and `Elements Should Be Equal`).
- Modifying XML and saving it (e.g. `Set Element Text`, `Add Element`
  and `Save XML`).

= Parsing XML =

XML can be parsed into an element structure using `Parse XML` keyword.
It accepts both paths to XML files and strings that contain XML. The
keyword returns the root element of the structure, which then contains
other elements as its children and their children. Possible comments and
processing instructions in the source XML are removed.

XML is not validated during parsing even if has a schema defined. How
possible doctype elements are handled otherwise depends on the used XML
module and on the platform. The standard ElementTree strips doctypes
altogether but when `using lxml` they are preserved when XML is saved.
With IronPython parsing XML with a doctype is not supported at all.

The element structure returned by `Parse XML`, as well as elements
returned by keywords such as `Get Element`, can be used as the ``source``
argument with other keywords. In addition to an already parsed XML
structure, other keywords also accept paths to XML files and strings
containing XML similarly as `Parse XML`. Notice that keywords that modify
XML do not write those changes back to disk even if the source would be
given as a path to a file. Changes must always saved explicitly using
`Save XML` keyword.

When the source is given as a path to a file, the forward slash character
(``/``) can be used as the path separator regardless the operating system.
On Windows also the backslash works, but it the test data it needs to be
escaped by doubling it (``\\``). Using the built-in variable ``${/}``
naturally works too.

= Using lxml =

By default this library uses Python's standard
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html|ElementTree]
module for parsing XML, but it can be configured to use
[http://lxml.de|lxml] module instead when `importing` the library.
The resulting element structure has same API regardless which module
is used for parsing.

The main benefits of using lxml is that it supports richer xpath syntax
than the standard ElementTree and enables using `Evaluate Xpath` keyword.
It also preserves the doctype and possible namespace prefixes saving XML.

The lxml support is new in Robot Framework 2.8.5.

= Example =

The following simple example demonstrates parsing XML and verifying its
contents both using keywords in this library and in _BuiltIn_ and
_Collections_ libraries. How to use xpath expressions to find elements
and what attributes the returned elements contain are discussed, with
more examples, in `Finding elements with xpath` and `Element attributes`
sections.

In this example, as well as in many other examples in this documentation,
``${XML}`` refers to the following example XML document. In practice
``${XML}`` could either be a path to an XML file or it could contain the XML
itself.

| &lt;example&gt;
|   &lt;first id="1"&gt;text&lt;/first&gt;
|   &lt;second id="2"&gt;
|     &lt;child/&gt;
|   &lt;/second&gt;
|   &lt;third&gt;
|     &lt;child&gt;more text&lt;/child&gt;
|     &lt;second id="child"/&gt;
|     &lt;child&gt;&lt;grandchild/&gt;&lt;/child&gt;
|   &lt;/third&gt;
|   &lt;html&gt;
|     &lt;p&gt;
|       Text with &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;.
|     &lt;/p&gt;
|   &lt;/html&gt;
| &lt;/example&gt;

| ${root} =                | `Parse XML`   | ${XML}  |       |             |
| `Should Be Equal`        | ${root.tag}   | example |       |             |
| ${first} =               | `Get Element` | ${root} | first |             |
| `Should Be Equal`        | ${first.text} | text    |       |             |
| `Dictionary Should Contain Key` | ${first.attrib}  | id    |             |
| `Element Text Should Be` | ${first}      | text    |       |             |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${first} | id      | 1     |             |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${root}  | id      | 1     | xpath=first |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${XML}   | id      | 1     | xpath=first |

Notice that in the example three last lines are equivalent. Which one to
use in practice depends on which other elements you need to get or verify.
If you only need to do one verification, using the last line alone would
suffice. If more verifications are needed, parsing the XML with `Parse XML`
only once would be more efficient.

= Finding elements with xpath =

ElementTree, and thus also this library, supports finding elements using
xpath expressions. ElementTree does not, however, support the full xpath
syntax, and what is supported depends on its version. ElementTree 1.3 that
is distributed with Python 2.7 supports richer syntax than earlier versions.

The supported xpath syntax is explained below and
[http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm|ElementTree documentation]
provides more details. In the examples ``${XML}`` refers to the same XML
structure as in the earlier example.

If lxml support is enabled when `importing` the library, the whole
[http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/|xpath 1.0 standard] is supported.
That includes everything listed below but also lot of other useful
constructs.

== Tag names ==

When just a single tag name is used, xpath matches all direct child
elements that have that tag name.

| ${elem} =          | `Get Element`  | ${XML}      | third |
| `Should Be Equal`  | ${elem.tag}    | third       |       |
| @{children} =      | `Get Elements` | ${elem}     | child |
| `Length Should Be` | ${children}    | 2           |       |

== Paths ==

Paths are created by combining tag names with a forward slash (``/``). For
example, ``parent/child`` matches all ``child`` elements under ``parent``
element. Notice that if there are multiple ``parent`` elements that all
have ``child`` elements, ``parent/child`` xpath will match all these
``child`` elements.

| ${elem} =         | `Get Element` | ${XML}     | second/child            |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${elem.tag}   | child      |                         |
| ${elem} =         | `Get Element` | ${XML}     | third/child/grandchild  |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${elem.tag}   | grandchild |                         |

== Wildcards ==

An asterisk (``*``) can be used in paths instead of a tag name to denote
any element.

| @{children} =      | `Get Elements` | ${XML} | */child |
| `Length Should Be` | ${children}    | 3      |         |

== Current element ==

The current element is denoted with a dot (``.``). Normally the current
element is implicit and does not need to be included in the xpath.

== Parent element ==

The parent element of another element is denoted with two dots (``..``).
Notice that it is not possible to refer to the parent of the current
element. This syntax is supported only in ElementTree 1.3 (i.e.
Python/Jython 2.7 and newer).

| ${elem} =         | `Get Element` | ${XML} | */second/.. |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${elem.tag}   | third  |             |

== Search all sub elements ==

Two forward slashes (``//``) mean that all sub elements, not only the
direct children, are searched. If the search is started from the current
element, an explicit dot is required.

| @{elements} =      | `Get Elements` | ${XML} | .//second |
| `Length Should Be` | ${elements}    | 2      |           |
| ${b} =             | `Get Element`  | ${XML} | html//b   |
| `Should Be Equal`  | ${b.text}      | bold   |           |

== Predicates ==

Predicates allow selecting elements using also other criteria than tag
names, for example, attributes or position. They are specified after the
normal tag name or path using syntax ``path[predicate]``. The path can have
wildcards and other special syntax explained above.

What predicates ElementTree supports is explained in the table below.
Notice that predicates in general are supported only in ElementTree 1.3
(i.e. Python/Jython 2.7 and newer).

|  = Predicate =  |             = Matches =           |    = Example =     |
| @attrib         | Elements with attribute ``attrib``. | second[@id]        |
| @attrib="value" | Elements with attribute ``attrib`` having value ``value``. | *[@id="2"] |
| position        | Elements at the specified position. Position can be an integer (starting from 1), expression ``last()``, or relative expression like ``last() - 1``. | third/child[1] |
| tag             | Elements with a child element named ``tag``. | third/child[grandchild] |

Predicates can also be stacked like ``path[predicate1][predicate2]``.
A limitation is that possible position predicate must always be first.

= Element attributes =

All keywords returning elements, such as `Parse XML`, and `Get Element`,
return ElementTree's
[http://docs.python.org/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element|Element objects].
These elements can be used as inputs for other keywords, but they also
contain several useful attributes that can be accessed directly using
the extended variable syntax.

The attributes that are both useful and convenient to use in the test
data are explained below. Also other attributes, including methods, can
be accessed, but that is typically better to do in custom libraries than
directly in the test data.

The examples use the same ``${XML}`` structure as the earlier examples.

== tag ==

The tag of the element.

| ${root} =         | `Parse XML` | ${XML}  |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${root.tag} | example |

== text ==

The text that the element contains or Python ``None`` if the element has no
text. Notice that the text _does not_ contain texts of possible child
elements nor text after or between children. Notice also that in XML
whitespace is significant, so the text contains also possible indentation
and newlines. To get also text of the possible children, optionally
whitespace normalized, use `Get Element Text` keyword.

| ${1st} =          | `Get Element` | ${XML}  | first        |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${1st.text}   | text    |              |
| ${2nd} =          | `Get Element` | ${XML}  | second/child |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${2nd.text}   | ${NONE} |              |
| ${p} =            | `Get Element` | ${XML}  | html/p       |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${p.text}     | \n${SPACE*6}Text with${SPACE} |

== tail ==

The text after the element before the next opening or closing tag. Python
``None`` if the element has no tail. Similarly as with ``text``, also
``tail`` contains possible indentation and newlines.

| ${b} =            | `Get Element` | ${XML}  | html/p/b  |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${b.tail}     | ${SPACE}and${SPACE} |

== attrib ==

A Python dictionary containing attributes of the element.

| ${2nd} =          | `Get Element`       | ${XML} | second |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${2nd.attrib['id']} | 2      |        |
| ${3rd} =          | `Get Element`       | ${XML} | third  |
| `Should Be Empty` | ${3rd.attrib}       |        |        |

= Handling XML namespaces =

ElementTree and lxml handle possible namespaces in XML documents by adding
the namespace URI to tag names in so called Clark Notation. That is
inconvenient especially with xpaths, and by default this library strips
those namespaces away and moves them to ``xmlns`` attribute instead. That
can be avoided by passing ``keep_clark_notation`` argument to `Parse XML`
keyword. Alternatively `Parse XML` supports stripping namespace information
altogether by using ``strip_namespaces`` argument. The pros and cons of
different approaches are discussed in more detail below.

== How ElementTree handles namespaces ==

If an XML document has namespaces, ElementTree adds namespace information
to tag names in [http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm|Clark Notation]
(e.g. ``{http://ns.uri}tag``) and removes original ``xmlns`` attributes.
This is done both with default namespaces and with namespaces with a prefix.
How it works in practice is illustrated by the following example, where
``${NS}`` variable contains this XML document:

| &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
|                 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
|   &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
|     &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
|   &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
| &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

| ${root} = | `Parse XML` | ${NS} | keep_clark_notation=yes |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${root.tag} | {http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform}stylesheet |
| `Element Should Exist` | ${root} | {http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform}template/{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}html |
| `Should Be Empty` | ${root.attrib} |

As you can see, including the namespace URI in tag names makes xpaths
really long and complex.

If you save the XML, ElementTree moves namespace information back to
``xmlns`` attributes. Unfortunately it does not restore the original
prefixes:

| &lt;ns0:stylesheet xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
|   &lt;ns0:template match="/"&gt;
|     &lt;ns1:html xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;/ns1:html&gt;
|   &lt;/ns0:template&gt;
| &lt;/ns0:stylesheet&gt;

The resulting output is semantically same as the original, but mangling
prefixes like this may still not be desirable. Notice also that the actual
output depends slightly on ElementTree version.

== Default namespace handling ==

Because the way ElementTree handles namespaces makes xpaths so complicated,
this library, by default, strips namespaces from tag names and moves that
information back to ``xmlns`` attributes. How this works in practice is
shown by the example below, where ``${NS}`` variable contains the same XML
document as in the previous example.

| ${root} = | `Parse XML` | ${NS} |
| `Should Be Equal` | ${root.tag} | stylesheet |
| `Element Should Exist` | ${root} | template/html |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${root} | xmlns | http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${root} | xmlns | http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml | xpath=template/html |

Now that tags do not contain namespace information, xpaths are simple again.

A minor limitation of this approach is that namespace prefixes are lost.
As a result the saved output is not exactly same as the original one in
this case either:

| &lt;stylesheet xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
|   &lt;template match="/"&gt;
|     &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
|   &lt;/template&gt;
| &lt;/stylesheet&gt;

Also this output is semantically same as the original. If the original XML
had only default namespaces, the output would also look identical.

== Namespaces when using lxml ==

This library handles namespaces same way both when `using lxml` and when
not using it. There are, however, differences how lxml internally handles
namespaces compared to the standard ElementTree. The main difference is
that lxml stores information about namespace prefixes and they are thus
preserved if XML is saved. Another visible difference is that lxml includes
namespace information in child elements got with `Get Element` if the
parent element has namespaces.

== Stripping namespaces altogether ==

Because namespaces often add unnecessary complexity, `Parse XML` supports
stripping them altogether by using ``strip_namespaces=True``. When this
option is enabled, namespaces are not shown anywhere nor are they included
if XML is saved.

== Attribute namespaces ==

Attributes in XML documents are, by default, in the same namespaces as
the element they belong to. It is possible to use different namespaces
by using prefixes, but this is pretty rare.

If an attribute has a namespace prefix, ElementTree will replace it with
Clark Notation the same way it handles elements. Because stripping
namespaces from attributes could cause attribute conflicts, this library
does not handle attribute namespaces at all. Thus the following example
works the same way regardless how namespaces are handled.

| ${root} = | `Parse XML` | &lt;root id="1" ns:id="2" xmlns:ns="http://my.ns"/&gt; |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${root} | id | 1 |
| `Element Attribute Should Be` | ${root} | {http://my.ns}id | 2 |

= Boolean arguments =

Some keywords accept arguments that are handled as Boolean values true or
false. If such an argument is given as a string, it is considered false if
it is either an empty string or case-insensitively equal to ``false``,
``none`` or ``no``. Other strings are considered true regardless
their value, and other argument types are tested using the same
[http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing|rules
as in Python].

True examples:
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=True    | # Strings are generally true.    |
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=yes     | # Same as the above.             |
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=${TRUE} | # Python ``True`` is true.       |
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=${42}   | # Numbers other than 0 are true. |

False examples:
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=False    | # String ``false`` is false.   |
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=no       | # Also string ``no`` is false. |
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=${EMPTY} | # Empty string is false.       |
| `Parse XML` | ${XML} | keep_clark_notation=${FALSE} | # Python ``False`` is false.   |

Prior to Robot Framework 2.9, all non-empty strings, including ``false``
and ``no``, were considered to be true. Considering ``none`` false is
new in Robot Framework 3.0.3.</doc>

<doc>Import library with optionally lxml mode enabled.

By default this library uses Python's standard
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html|ElementTree]
module for parsing XML. If ``use_lxml`` argument is given a true value
(see `Boolean arguments`), the library will use [http://lxml.de|lxml]
module instead. See `Using lxml` section for benefits provided by lxml.

Using lxml requires that the lxml module is installed on the system.
If lxml mode is enabled but the module is not installed, this library
will emit a warning and revert back to using the standard ElementTree.

The support for lxml is new in Robot Framework 2.8.5.</doc>

<doc>Adds a child element to the specified element.

The element to whom to add the new element is specified using ``source``
and ``xpath``. They have exactly the same semantics as with `Get Element`
keyword. The resulting XML structure is returned, and if the ``source``
is an already parsed XML structure, it is also modified in place.

The ``element`` to add can be specified as a path to an XML file or
as a string containing XML, or it can be an already parsed XML element.
The element is copied before adding so modifying either the original
or the added element has no effect on the other
.
The element is added as the last child by default, but a custom index
can be used to alter the position. Indices start from zero (0 = first
position, 1 = second position, etc.), and negative numbers refer to
positions at the end (-1 = second last position, -2 = third last, etc.).

Examples using ``${XML}`` structure from `Example`:
| Add Element | ${XML} | &lt;new id="x"&gt;&lt;c1/&gt;&lt;/new&gt; |

<doc>Verifies that the specified attribute is ``expected``.

The element whose attribute is verified is specified using ``source``

`Get Element` keyword.

The keyword passes if the attribute ``name`` of the element is equal to
the ``expected`` value, and otherwise it fails. The default error
message can be overridden with the ``message`` argument.

To test that the element does not have a certain attribute, Python
``None`` (i.e. variable ``${NONE}``) can be used as the expected value.
A cleaner alternative is using `Element Should Not Have Attribute`.

Examples using ``${XML}`` structure from `Example`:
| Element Attribute Should Be | ${XML} | id | 1       | xpath=first |
| Element Attribute Should Be | ${XML} | id | ${NONE} |             |

This keyword works exactly like `Element Attribute Should Be` except

Pattern matching is similar as matching files in a shell, and it is
always case-sensitive. In the pattern, '*' matches anything and '?'
matches any single character.

The element whose text is verified is specified using ``source`` and

The text to verify is got from the specified element using the same
logic as with `Get Element Text`. This includes optional whitespace
normalization using the ``normalize_whitespace`` option.

The keyword passes if the text of the element is equal to the
``expected`` value, and otherwise it fails. The default error message

<doc>Verifies that the given ``source`` element is equal to ``expected``.

Both ``source`` and ``expected`` can be given as a path to an XML file,
as a string containing XML, or as an already parsed XML element
structure. See `introduction` for more information about parsing XML in
general.

The keyword passes if the ``source`` element and ``expected`` element
are equal. This includes testing the tag names, texts, and attributes
of the elements. By default also child elements are verified the same
way, but this can be disabled by setting ``exclude_children`` to a
true value (see `Boolean arguments`).

All texts inside the given elements are verified, but possible text
outside them is not. By default texts must match exactly, but setting
``normalize_whitespace`` to a true value makes text verification
independent on newlines, tabs, and the amount of spaces. For more
details about handling text see `Get Element Text` keyword and
discussion about elements' `text` and `tail` attributes in the
`introduction`.

Examples using ``${XML}`` structure from `Example`:
| ${first} =               | Get Element | ${XML} | first             |
| Elements Should Be Equal | ${first}    | &lt;first id="1"&gt;text&lt;/first&gt; |
| ${p} =                   | Get Element | ${XML} | html/p            |
| Elements Should Be Equal | ${p} | &lt;p&gt;Text with &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; | normalize_whitespace=yes |
| Elements Should Be Equal | ${p} | &lt;p&gt;Text with&lt;/p&gt; | exclude | normalize |

The last example may look a bit strange because the ``&lt;p&gt;`` element
only has text ``Text with``. The reason is that rest of the text
inside ``&lt;p&gt;`` actually belongs to the child elements. This includes
the ``.`` at the end that is the `tail` text of the ``&lt;i&gt;`` element.

The ``source`` can be a path to an XML file, a string containing XML, or
an already parsed XML element. The ``xpath`` specifies which element to
find. See the `introduction` for more details about both the possible
sources and the supported xpath syntax.

The keyword fails if more, or less, than one element matches the

`Parse XML` is recommended for parsing XML when the whole structure
is needed. It must be used if there is a need to configure how XML
namespaces are handled.

Many other keywords use this keyword internally, and keywords modifying
XML are typically documented to both to modify the given source and
to return it. Modifying the source does not apply if the source is
given as a string. The XML structure parsed based on the string and
then modified is nevertheless returned.</doc>

The element whose text to return is specified using ``source`` and
``xpath``. They have exactly the same semantics as with `Get Element`
keyword.

This keyword returns all the text of the specified element, including
all the text its children and grandchildren contain. If the element
has no text, an empty string is returned. The returned text is thus not
always the same as the `text` attribute of the element.

By default all whitespace, including newlines and indentation, inside
the element is returned as-is. If ``normalize_whitespace`` is given
a true value (see `Boolean arguments`), then leading and trailing
whitespace is stripped, newlines and tabs converted to spaces, and
multiple spaces collapsed into one. This is especially useful when
dealing with HTML data.

Examples using ``${XML}`` structure from `Example`:
| ${text} =       | Get Element Text | ${XML}       | first        |

<doc>Parses the given XML file or string into an element structure.

The ``source`` can either be a path to an XML file or a string
containing XML. In both cases the XML is parsed into ElementTree
[http://docs.python.org/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element|element structure]
and the root element is returned. Possible comments and processing
instructions in the source XML are removed.

As discussed in `Handling XML namespaces` section, this keyword, by
default, removes namespace information ElementTree has added to tag
names and moves it into ``xmlns`` attributes. This typically eases
handling XML documents with namespaces considerably. If you do not
want that to happen, or want to avoid the small overhead of going
through the element structure when your XML does not have namespaces,
you can disable this feature by giving ``keep_clark_notation`` argument
a true value (see `Boolean arguments`).

If you want to strip namespace information altogether so that it is
not included even if XML is saved, you can give a true value to
``strip_namespaces`` argument. This functionality is new in Robot
Framework 3.0.2.

Examples:
| ${root} = | Parse XML | &lt;root&gt;&lt;child/&gt;&lt;/root&gt; |
| ${xml} = | Parse XML | ${CURDIR}/test.xml | keep_clark_notation=True |
| ${xml} = | Parse XML | ${CURDIR}/test.xml | strip_namespaces=True |

keyword. The resulting XML structure is returned, and if the ``source``
is an already parsed XML structure, it is also modified in place.

Element's text and tail text are changed only if new ``text`` and/or
``tail`` values are given. See `Element attributes` section for more
information about `text` and `tail` in general.

Examples using ``${XML}`` structure from `Example`:
| Set Element Text       | ${XML} | new text | xpath=first    |
| Element Text Should Be | ${XML} | new text | xpath=first    |
| Set Element Text       | ${XML} | tail=&amp;   | xpath=html/p/b |
| Element Text Should Be | ${XML} | Text with bold&amp;italics. | xpath=html/p  | normalize_whitespace=yes |
| Set Element Text       | ${XML} | slanted  | !! | xpath=html/p/i |
| Element Text Should Be | ${XML} | Text with bold&amp;slanted!! | xpath=html/p  | normalize_whitespace=yes |

Can only set the text/tail of a single element. Use `Set Elements Text`
to set the text/tail of multiple elements in one call.</doc>
