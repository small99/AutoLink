<doc>SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for Robot Framework.

This document explains how to use keywords provided by SeleniumLibrary.
For information about installation, support, and more, please visit the
[https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary|project pages].
For more information about Robot Framework, see http://robotframework.org.

SeleniumLibrary uses the Selenium WebDriver modules internally to
control a web browser. See http://seleniumhq.org for more information
about Selenium in general.

= Locating elements =

All keywords in SeleniumLibrary that need to interact with an element
on a web page take an argument typically named ``locator`` that specifies
how to find the element. Most often the locator is given as a string
using the locator syntax described below, but `using WebElements` is
possible too.

== Locator syntax ==

SeleniumLibrary supports finding elements based on different strategies
such as the element id, XPath expressions, or CSS selectors. The strategy
can either be explicitly specified with a prefix or the strategy can be
implicit.

=== Default locator strategy ===

By default locators are considered to use the keyword specific default
locator strategy. All keywords support finding elements based on ``id``
and ``name`` attributes, but some keywords support additional attributes
or other values that make sense in their context. For example, `Click
Link` supports the ``href`` attribute and the link text and addition
to the normal ``id`` and ``name``.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | example | # Match based on ``id`` or ``name``.            |
| `Click Link`    | example | # Match also based on link text and ``href``.   |
| `Click Button`  | example | # Match based on ``id``, ``name`` or ``value``. |

If a locator accidentally starts with a prefix recognized as `explicit
locator strategy` or `implicit XPath strategy`, it is possible to use
the explicit ``default`` prefix to enable the default strategy.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | name:foo         | # Find element with name ``foo``.               |
| `Click Element` | default:name:foo | # Use default strategy with value ``name:foo``. |
| `Click Element` | //foo            | # Find element using XPath ``//foo``.           |
| `Click Element` | default: //foo   | # Use default strategy with value ``//foo``.    |

=== Explicit locator strategy ===

The explicit locator strategy is specified with a prefix using either
syntax ``strategy:value`` or ``strategy=value``. The former syntax
is preferred, because the latter is identical to Robot Framework's
[http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#named-argument-syntax|
named argument syntax] and that can cause problems. Spaces around
the separator are ignored, so ``id:foo``, ``id: foo`` and ``id : foo``
are all equivalent.

Locator strategies that are supported by default are listed in the table
below. In addition to them, it is possible to register `custom locators`.

| = Strategy = |          = Match based on =         |         = Example =            |
| id           | Element ``id``.                     | ``id:example``                 |
| name         | ``name`` attribute.                 | ``name:example``               |
| identifier   | Either ``id`` or ``name``.          | ``identifier:example``         |
| class        | Element ``class``.                  | ``class:example``              |
| tag          | Tag name.                           | ``tag:div``                    |
| xpath        | XPath expression.                   | ``xpath://div[@id="example"]`` |
| css          | CSS selector.                       | ``css:div#example``            |
| dom          | DOM expression.                     | ``dom:document.images[5]``     |
| link         | Exact text a link has.              | ``link:The example``           |
| partial link | Partial link text.                  | ``partial link:he ex``         |
| sizzle       | Sizzle selector provided by jQuery. | ``sizzle:div.example``         |
| jquery       | Same as the above.                  | ``jquery:div.example``         |
| default      | Keyword specific default behavior.  | ``default:example``            |

See the `Default locator strategy` section below for more information
about how the default strategy works. Using the explicit ``default``
prefix is only necessary if the locator value itself accidentally
matches some of the explicit strategies.

Different locator strategies have different pros and cons. Using ids,
either explicitly like ``id:foo`` or by using the `default locator
strategy` simply like ``foo``, is recommended when possible, because
the syntax is simple and locating elements by an id is fast for browsers.
If an element does not have an id or the id is not stable, other
solutions need to be used. If an element has a unique tag name or class,
using ``tag``, ``class`` or ``css`` strategy like ``tag:h1``,
``class:example`` or ``css:h1.example`` is often an easy solution. In
more complex cases using XPath expressions is typically the best
approach. They are very powerful but a downside is that they can also
get complex.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | id:foo                      | # Element with id 'foo'. |
| `Click Element` | css:div#foo h1              | # h1 element under div with id 'foo'. |
| `Click Element` | xpath: //div[@id="foo"]//h1 | # Same as the above using XPath, not CSS. |
| `Click Element` | xpath: //*[contains(text(), "example")] | # Element containing text 'example'. |

*NOTE:*

- The ``strategy:value`` syntax is only supported by SeleniumLibrary 3.0
  and newer.
- Using the ``sizzle`` strategy or its alias ``jquery`` requires that
  the system under test contains the jQuery library.
- Prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0, table related keywords only supported
  ``xpath``, ``css`` and ``sizzle/jquery`` strategies.

=== Implicit XPath strategy ===

If the locator starts with ``//`` or ``(//``, the locator is considered
to be an XPath expression. In other words, using ``//div`` is equivalent
to using explicit ``xpath://div``.

Examples:

| `Click Element` | //div[@id="foo"]//h1 |
| `Click Element` | (//div)[2]           |

The support for the ``(//`` prefix is new in SeleniumLibrary 3.0.

== Using WebElements ==

In addition to specifying a locator as a string, it is possible to use
Selenium's WebElement objects. This requires first getting a WebElement,
for example, by using the `Get WebElement` keyword.

| ${elem} =       | `Get WebElement` | id:example |
| `Click Element` | ${elem}          |            |

== Custom locators ==

If more complex lookups are required than what is provided through the
default locators, custom lookup strategies can be created. Using custom
locators is a two part process. First, create a keyword that returns
a WebElement that should be acted on:

| Custom Locator Strategy | [Arguments] | ${browser} | ${strategy} | ${tag} | ${constraints} |
|   | ${element}= | Execute Javascript | return window.document.getElementById('${criteria}'); |
|   | [Return] | ${element} |

This keyword is a reimplementation of the basic functionality of the
``id`` locator where ``${browser}`` is a reference to a WebDriver
instance and ``${strategy}`` is name of the locator strategy. To use
this locator it must first be registered by using the
`Add Location Strategy` keyword:

| `Add Location Strategy` | custom | Custom Locator Strategy |

The first argument of `Add Location Strategy` specifies the name of
the strategy and it must be unique. After registering the strategy,
the usage is the same as with other locators:

| `Click Element` | custom:example |

See the `Add Location Strategy` keyword for more details.

= Timeouts, waits and delays =

This section discusses different ways how to wait for elements to
appear on web pages and to slow down execution speed otherwise.
It also explains the `time format` that can be used when setting various
timeouts, waits and delays.

== Timeout ==

SeleniumLibrary contains various keywords that have an optional
``timeout`` argument that specifies how long these keywords should
wait for certain events or actions. These keywords include, for example,
``Wait ...`` keywords and keywords related to alerts.

The default timeout these keywords use can be set globally either by
using the `Set Selenium Timeout` keyword or with the ``timeout`` argument
when `importing` the library. See `time format` below for supported
timeout syntax.

== Implicit wait ==

Implicit wait specifies the maximum time how long Selenium waits when
searching for elements. It can be set by using the `Set Selenium Implicit
Wait` keyword or with the ``implicit_wait`` argument when `importing`
the library. See [http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html|
Selenium documentation] for more information about this functionality.

See `time format` below for supported syntax.

== Selenium speed ==

Selenium execution speed can be slowed down globally by using `Set
Selenium speed` keyword. This functionality is designed to be used for
demonstrating or debugging purposes. Using it to make sure that elements
appear on a page is not a good idea, and the above explained timeouts
and waits should be used instead.

See `time format` below for supported syntax.

== Time format ==

All timeouts and waits can be given as numbers considered seconds
(e.g. ``0.5`` or ``42``) or in Robot Framework's time syntax
(e.g. ``1.5 seconds`` or ``1 min 30 s``). For more information about
the time syntax see the
[http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#time-format|Robot Framework User Guide].

= Run-on-failure functionality =

SeleniumLibrary has a handy feature that it can automatically execute
a keyword if any of its own keywords fails. By default it uses the
`Capture Page Screenshot` keyword, but this can be changed either by
using the `Register Keyword To Run On Failure` keyword or with the
``run_on_failure`` argument when `importing` the library. It is
possible to use any keyword from any imported library or resource file.

The run-on-failure functionality can be disabled by using a special
value ``NOTHING`` or anything considered false (see `Boolean arguments`)
such as ``NONE``.

= Boolean arguments =

Some keywords accept arguments that are handled as Boolean values true or
false. If such an argument is given as a string, it is considered false if
it is either empty or case-insensitively equal to ``false``, ``no`` or
``none``. Other strings are considered true regardless their value, and
other argument types are tested using same
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing|rules as in Python].

True examples:

| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=True    | # Strings are generally true.    |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=yes     | # Same as the above.             |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=${TRUE} | # Python True is true.           |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=${42}   | # Numbers other than 0 are true. |

False examples:

| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=False    | # String false is false.        |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=no       | # Also string no is false.      |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=NONE     | # String NONE is false.         |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=${EMPTY} | # Empty string is false.        |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=${FALSE} | # Python False is false.        |
| `Set Screenshot Directory` | ${RESULTS} | persist=${NONE}  | # Python None is false.         |

Note that prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0, all non-empty strings, including
``false``, ``no`` and ``none``, were considered true.</doc>

<doc>Adds a cookie to your current session.

``name`` and ``value`` are required, ``path``, ``domain``, ``secure``
and ``expiry`` are optional.  Expiry supports the same formats as
the [http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/DateTime.html|DateTime]
library or an epoch time stamp.

Example:
| `Add Cookie` | foo | bar |                            |
| `Add Cookie` | foo | bar | domain=example.com         |

</arguments>
<doc>Verifies that an alert is present and, by default, accepts it.

Fails if no alert is present. If ``text`` is a non-empty string,
then it is used to verify alert's message. The alert is accepted
by default, but that behavior can be controlled by using the
``action`` argument same way as with `Handle Alert`.

``timeout`` specifies how long to wait for the alert to appear.
If it is not given, the global default `timeout` is used instead.

``action`` and ``timeout`` arguments are new in SeleniumLibrary 3.0.
In earlier versions the alert was always accepted and timeout was
hard coded to one second.</doc>

<kw name="Alert Should Not Be Present">

If the alert actually exists, the ``action`` argument determines
how it should be handled. By default the alert is accepted, but
it can be also dismissed or left open the same way as with the
`Handle Alert` keyword.

``timeout`` specifies how long to wait for the alert to appear.
By default the alert is not waited at all, but a custom time can
be given if alert may be delayed. See the `time format` section
for information about the syntax.

</arguments>
<doc>Assigns temporary ``id`` to element specified by ``locator``.

This is mainly useful if the locator is complicated and/or slow XPath
expression and it is needed multiple times. Identifier expires when
the page is reloaded.

See the `Locating elements` section for details about the locator
syntax.

Example:
| `Assign ID to Element` | //ul[@class='example' and ./li[contains(., 'Stuff')]] | my id |
| `Page Should Contain Element` | my id |</doc>

</kw>
<kw name="Capture Page Screenshot">
<arguments>
<arg>filename=selenium-screenshot-{index}.png</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Takes screenshot of the current page and embeds it into log file.

``filename`` argument specifies the name of the file to write the
screenshot into. The directory where screenshots are saved can be
set when `importing` the library or by using the `Set Screenshot
Directory` keyword. If the directory is not configured, screenshots
are saved to the same directory where Robot Framework's log file is
written.

Starting from SeleniumLibrary 1.8, if ``filename`` contains marker
``{index}``, it will be automatically replaced with unique running
index preventing files to be overwritten. Indices start from 1,
and how they are represented can be customized using Python's
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings|
format string syntax].

An absolute path to the created screenshot file is returned.

Examples:
| `Capture Page Screenshot` |                                        |
| `File Should Exist`       | ${OUTPUTDIR}/selenium-screenshot-1.png |
| ${path} =                 | `Capture Page Screenshot`              |
| `File Should Exist`       | ${OUTPUTDIR}/selenium-screenshot-2.png |

Like `Open Browser`, but allows passing arguments to the created
WebDriver instance directly. This keyword should only be used if
functionality provided by `Open Browser` is not adequate.

``driver_name`` must be an WebDriver implementation name like Firefox,

The initialized WebDriver can be configured either with a Python
dictionary ``kwargs`` or by using keyword arguments ``**init_kwargs``.
These arguments are passed directly to WebDriver without any
processing. See [https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/api.html|
Selenium API documentation] for details about the supported arguments.

Examples:
| # Use proxy with Firefox   |                |                                           |                         |

<doc>Executes asynchronous JavaScript code.

Similar to `Execute Javascript` except that scripts executed with
this keyword must explicitly signal they are finished by invoking the
provided callback. This callback is always injected into the executed
function as the last argument.

Scripts must complete within the script timeout or this keyword will
fail. See the `Timeouts` section for more information.

Examples:
| `Execute Async JavaScript` | var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1]; window.setTimeout(callback, 2000); |
| `Execute Async JavaScript` | ${CURDIR}/async_js_to_execute.js |
| ${result} = | `Execute Async JavaScript`                      |

<kw name="Execute Javascript">

<arg>*code</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Executes the given JavaScript code.

``code`` may contain multiple lines of code and may be divided into
multiple cells in the test data. In that case, the parts are
concatenated together without adding spaces.

If ``code`` is an absolute path to an existing file, the JavaScript
to execute will be read from that file. Forward slashes work as
a path separator on all operating systems.

The JavaScript executes in the context of the currently selected
frame or window as the body of an anonymous function. Use ``window``
to refer to the window of your application and ``document`` to refer
to the document object of the current frame or window, e.g.
``document.getElementById('example')``.

This keyword returns whatever the executed JavaScript code returns.
Return values are converted to the appropriate Python types.

Examples:
| `Execute JavaScript` | window.myFunc('arg1', 'arg2') |
| `Execute JavaScript` | ${CURDIR}/js_to_execute.js    |
| ${sum} =             | `Execute JavaScript` | return 1 + 1; |

Difference compared to `Input Text` is that this keyword does not

the keyword like

| Input Password | password_field | password |

the password is shown as a normal keyword argument. A way to avoid
that is using variables like

| Input Password | password_field | ${PASSWORD} |

Notice also that SeleniumLibrary logs all the communication with
browser drivers using the DEBUG level, and the actual password can
be seen there. Additionally Robot Framework logs all arguments using
the TRACE level. Tests must thus not be executed using level below
INFO if password should not be logged in any format.</doc>

The ``browser`` argument specifies which browser to use, and the
supported browser are listed in the table below. The browser names
are case-insensitive and some browsers have multiple supported names.

To be able to actually use one of these browsers, you need to have
a matching Selenium browser driver available. See the
[https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary#browser-drivers|
project documentation] for more details. Headless Firefox and
Headless Chrome are new additions in SeleniumLibrary 3.1.0
and require Selenium 3.8.0 or newer.

Optional ``alias`` is an alias given for this browser instance and
it can be used for switching between browsers. An alternative
approach for switching is using an index returned by this keyword.
These indices start from 1, are incremented when new browsers are
opened, and reset back to 1 when `Close All Browsers` is called.
See `Switch Browser` for more information and examples.

Optional ``remote_url`` is the URL for a
[https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2|Selenium Grid].

Optional ``desired_capabilities`` can be used to configure, for example,
logging preferences for a browser or a browser and operating system
when using [http://saucelabs.com|Sauce Labs]. Desired capabilities can
be given either as a Python dictionary or as a string in format
``key1:value1,key2:value2``.
[https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities|
Selenium documentation] lists possible capabilities that can be
enabled.

Optional ``ff_profile_dir`` is the path to the Firefox profile
directory if you wish to overwrite the default profile Selenium
uses. Notice that prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0, the library
contained its own profile that was used by default.

Examples:
| `Open Browser` | http://example.com | Chrome  |
| `Open Browser` | http://example.com | Firefox | alias=Firefox |
| `Open Browser` | http://example.com | Edge    | remote_url=http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub |

If the provided configuration options are not enough, it is possible
to use `Create Webdriver` to customize browser initialization even
more.

Applying ``desired_capabilities`` argument also for local browser is
new in SeleniumLibrary 3.1.</doc>

<kw name="Register Keyword To Run On Failure">
<arguments>
<arg>keyword</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Sets the keyword to execute when a SeleniumLibrary keyword fails.

``keyword`` is the name of a keyword that will be executed if a
SeleniumLibrary keyword fails. It is possible to use any available
keyword, including user keywords or keywords from other libraries,
but the keyword must not take any arguments.

The initial keyword to use is set when `importing` the library, and
the keyword that is used by default is `Capture Page Screenshot`.
Taking a screenshot when something failed is a very useful
feature, but notice that it can slow down the execution.

It is possible to use string ``NOTHING`` or ``NONE``,
case-insensitively, as well as Python ``None`` to disable this
feature altogether.

This keyword returns the name of the previously registered
failure keyword or Python ``None`` if this functionality was
previously disabled. The return value can be always used to
restore the original value later.

Example:
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`  | Log Source |
| ${previous kw}= | `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`  | NONE |
| `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`  | ${previous kw} |

Changes in SeleniumLibrary 3.0:
- Possible to use string ``NONE`` or Python ``None`` to disable the
  functionality.
- Return Python ``None`` when the functionality was disabled earlier.
  In previous versions special value ``No Keyword`` was returned and
  it could not be used to restore the original state.</doc>

<kw name="Select Window">
<arguments>
<arg>locator=MAIN</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Selects browser window matching ``locator``.

If the window is found, all subsequent commands use the selected
window, until this keyword is used again. If the window is not
found, this keyword fails. The previous window handle is returned,
and can be used to return back to it later.

Notice that in this context _window_ means a pop-up window opened
when doing something on an existing window. It is not possible to
select windows opened with `Open Browser`, `Switch Browser` must
be used instead. Notice also that alerts should be handled with
`Handle Alert` or other alert related keywords.

The ``locator`` can be specified using different strategies somewhat
similarly as when `locating elements` on pages.

- By default the ``locator`` is matched against window handle, name,
  title, and URL. Matching is done in that order and the the first
  matching window is selected.

- The ``locator`` can specify an explicit strategy by using format
  ``strategy:value`` (recommended) or ``strategy=value``. Supported
  strategies are ``name``, ``title`` and ``url``, which match windows
  using name, title, and URL, respectively. Additionally, ``default``
  can be used to explicitly use the default strategy explained above.

- If the ``locator`` is ``NEW`` (case-insensitive), the latest
  opened window is selected. It is an error if this is the same
  as the current window.

- If the ``locator`` is ``MAIN`` (default, case-insensitive),
  the main window is selected.

- If the ``locator`` is ``CURRENT`` (case-insensitive), nothing is
  done. This effectively just returns the current window handle.

- If the ``locator`` is not a string, it is expected to be a list
  of window handles _to exclude_. Such a list of excluded windows
  can be get from `Get Window Handles` prior to doing an action that
  opens a new window.

Example:
| `Click Link`      | popup1      |      | # Open new window |
| `Select Window`   | example     |      | # Select window using default strategy |
| `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 1    |      |
| `Click Button`    | popup2      |      | # Open another window |
| ${handle} = | `Select Window`   | NEW  | # Select latest opened window |
| `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 2    |      |
| `Select Window`   | ${handle}   |      | # Select window using handle |
| `Title Should Be` | Pop-up 1    |      |
| `Select Window`   | MAIN        |      | # Select the main window |

*NOTE:*

- The ``strategy:value`` syntax is only supported by SeleniumLibrary
  3.0 and newer.
- Earlier versions supported aliases ``None``, ``null`` and the
  empty string for selecting the main window, and alias ``self``
  for selecting the current window. These aliases were deprecated
  in SeleniumLibrary 3.0.
- Prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0 matching windows by name, title
  and URL was case-insensitive.</doc>

<kw name="Set Screenshot Directory">
<arguments>
<arg>path</arg>

<doc>Sets the directory for captured screenshots.

``path`` argument specifies the absolute path to a directory where
the screenshots should be written to. If the directory does not
exist, it will be created. The directory can also be set when
`importing` the library. If it is not configured anywhere,
screenshots are saved to the same directory where Robot Framework's
log file is written.

``persist`` argument is deprecated and has no effect.

The previous value is returned and can be used to restore
the original value later if needed.

Deprecating ``persist`` and returning the previous value are new

seconds or as a human readable string like ``1 second``.
The previous value is returned and can be used to restore
the original value later if needed.

This keyword sets the implicit wait for all opened browsers.
Use `Set Browser Implicit Wait` to set it only to the current
browser.

See the `Implicit wait` section above for more information.

Example:
| ${orig wait} = | `Set Selenium Implicit Wait` | 10 seconds |

<kw name="Set Window Position">
<arguments>
<arg>x</arg>
<arg>y</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Sets window position using ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates.

The position is relative to the top left corner of the screen,
but some browsers exclude possible task bar set by the operating
system from the calculation. The actual position may thus be
different with different browsers.

Values can be given using strings containing numbers or by using
actual numbers. See also `Get Window Position`.

Example:
| `Set Window Position` | 100 | 200 |</doc>
<tags>
</tags>
</kw>
<kw name="Set Window Size">
<arguments>
<arg>width</arg>
<arg>height</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Sets current windows size to given ``width`` and ``height``.

Values can be given using strings containing numbers or by using
actual numbers. See also `Get Window Size`.

Browsers have a limit how small they can be set. Trying to set them
smaller will cause the actual size to be bigger than the requested
size.

<kw name="Switch Browser">
<arguments>
<arg>index_or_alias</arg>
</arguments>
<doc>Switches between active browsers using ``index_or_alias``.

Indices are returned by the `Open Browser` keyword and aliases can
be given to it explicitly. Indices start from 1.

Example:
| `Open Browser`        | http://google.com | ff       |
| `Location Should Be`  | http://google.com |          |
| `Open Browser`        | http://yahoo.com  | ie       | alias=second |
| `Location Should Be`  | http://yahoo.com  |          |
| `Switch Browser`      | 1                 | # index  |
| `Page Should Contain` | I'm feeling lucky |          |
| `Switch Browser`      | second            | # alias  |
| `Page Should Contain` | More Yahoo!       |          |
| `Close All Browsers`  |                   |          |

Above example expects that there was no other open browsers when
opening the first one because it used index ``1`` when switching to
it later. If you are not sure about that, you can store the index
into a variable as below.

| ${index} =         | `Open Browser` | http://google.com |
| # Do something ... |                |                   |
